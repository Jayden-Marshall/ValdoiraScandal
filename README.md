## Overview

In response to suspicious activity observed on The Valdorian Times' network, a thorough investigation was launched. Our primary goals were to identify and mitigate security breaches, analyze the methods used by attackers, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance security defenses.

## Objectives

- Identify the source and extent of the security breach.
- Analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the attackers.
- Gather evidence to support incident response and remediation efforts.
- Offer recommendations to strengthen the organization's security posture.

## Methodology

1. **Initial Incident Response**: Isolating affected systems and collecting relevant evidence.
2. **Evidence Collection**: Gathering system logs, network traffic captures, and memory dumps.
3. **Email Analysis**: Analyzing suspicious emails for phishing indicators.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Examining logs to identify communication with external domains.
5. **System Forensics**: Analyzing system artifacts to reconstruct attacker activity.
6. **Malware Analysis**: Analyzing suspicious files and executables to identify malware functionality.
7. **Data Exfiltration Analysis**: Identifying data exfiltration attempts.

## What I Learned

- **Interpreting Security Logs**: How to read and interpret logs to identify evidence of malicious activity.
- **Using Azure Data Explorer (ADX) and Kusto Query Language (KQL)**: Querying and analyzing large datasets of log information.
- **Interpreting PowerShell Scripts and Malicious Commands**: Understanding attacker actions and intentions.
- **Formulating Analytical Questions**: Using data to answer precise questions and guide the investigation.

## Experience

The investigation was part of the KC7 Cyber "A Scandal in Valdoria" game, which took over 4 hours to complete. It was a challenging and intense experience, requiring meticulous attention to detail and perseverance through stressful moments.

- **Stress and Struggles**: The game demanded critical thinking and problem-solving under pressure, enhancing my ability to perform in high-stress situations.

## Recommendations

- Enhance email security with advanced threat detection and sandboxing capabilities.
- Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
- Strengthen network segmentation.
- Conduct regular security awareness training for employees.

## Conclusion

This digital forensics investigation provided valuable insights and highlighted areas for improvement. Implementing the recommendations will help The Valdorian Times enhance its defenses against cyber threats and mitigate the risk of future incidents.
